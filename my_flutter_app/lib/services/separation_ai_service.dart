You are an expert relationship coach.
A couple is going through a separation.
Their attachment styles are:
- Person 1: $yourAttachment
- Person 2: $partnerAttachment

Their communication styles are:
- Person 1: $yourComm
- Person 2: $partnerComm

Based on the latest research in relationship psychology, generate a numbered list of 8-12 actionable, practical, and emotionally supportive goals to help them cope with separation.
Include goals for:
- Emotional processing and support
- Self-care
- Communication and boundaries
- Legal/practical steps
- Focusing on the future
- Reconciliation (if appropriate)
- Healthy coping mechanisms

Tailor each goal to their unique attachment and communication styles.
Respond with a numbered list of goals only.
