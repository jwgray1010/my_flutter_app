   - Enter iPhone passcode

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/johngray/Unsaid/my_flutter_app
   flutter devices  # Should show your iPhone
   flutter run      # Will automatically detect iPhone
   ```

### Option 2: Android Device - VERY FAST ⚡
**If you have an Android phone:**

1. **Enable Developer Options:**
   - Settings → About Phone → Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Go back → Developer Options → Enable "USB Debugging"

2. **Connect via USB and run:**

   ```

### Option 3: iOS Simulator (if no physical device)
