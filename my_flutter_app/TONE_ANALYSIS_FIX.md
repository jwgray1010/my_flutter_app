# Tone Analysis Service Fix

## Problem Identified
The Message Lab screen was failing because it was trying to call an external cloud function:
```
https://us-central1-unsaid-3bc7c.cloudfunctions.net/analyzeTone
```

This external service was either:
- Not available/offline
- Blocked by CORS policy when running on web
- Causing network/authentication errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Local Tone Analysis Service
Created `/lib/services/tone_analysis_service.dart` with:
- **Comprehensive tone detection** for positive, negative, urgent, and polite tones
- **Keyword-based analysis** with weighted scoring
- **Smart suggestions** for improving message tone
- **Message improvement** with automatic replacements
- **Offline functionality** - no internet required

### 2. Updated Message Lab Screen
Modified `/lib/screens/message_lab_screen_professional.dart`:
- Removed dependency on external HTTP service
- Integrated local `ToneAnalysisService`
- Added proper error handling
- Maintained all existing UI functionality

### 3. Key Features
- **Real-time tone analysis** with confidence scores
- **Intelligent suggestions** based on detected tone issues
- **Message improvement** with automatic rewording
- **Multiple analysis modes**: Analyze, Improve, Translate, Summarize
- **Professional UI** with tone scores and visualizations

## Tone Detection Capabilities

### Positive Tone
Keywords: thank, thanks, please, appreciate, wonderful, great, excellent, amazing, etc.

### Negative Tone  
Keywords: hate, stupid, damn, terrible, awful, horrible, angry, frustrated, etc.

### Urgent Tone
Keywords: urgent, asap, immediately, must, deadline, critical, emergency, etc.

### Polite Tone
Keywords: could you, would you, if possible, sorry, excuse me, apologize, etc.

## Usage
The Message Lab now works completely offline and provides:
1. **Tone Analysis**: Detects dominant tone with confidence score
2. **Smart Suggestions**: Recommendations for improving message tone
3. **Message Improvement**: Automatically rewrites harsh or problematic language
4. **Professional UI**: Visual tone indicators and progress bars

## Testing
To test the tone analysis:
1. Navigate to Message Lab from home screen
2. Type a message (try: "This is stupid, fix it now!")
3. Click "Analyze Tone" 
4. See tone detection, suggestions, and improved message
5. Try different tones: positive, negative, urgent, polite

The tone analysis now works reliably without external dependencies!
